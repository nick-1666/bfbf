 The BrainFuck Binary Format is a tiny way to store  brainfuck

## Usage
There are two compiler flags so far:

- <kbd>-d</kbd> shows a debug list of current operations
- <kbd>-l</kbd> toggles lossy encoding (off by default) and will discard any indentation such as newlines or tabs when decoded.

Official documentation can be found at [BFBF's wiki page](https://esolangs.org/wiki/bfbf)
